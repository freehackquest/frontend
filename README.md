## PS Biography platform

Brief history and biography platform.

As a student in 2010-2011, I was part of the keva team.

After a few games, I had an idea of what a ctf game is.

Started with the resource http://hax.tor.hu/. I liked the resource.

As a result, I began to think about the idea of creating a platform for games but such that it could be used as an archive of tasks for training beginners and so that it would be possible to select tasks by force.

I also discussed this idea with the team. After a while, after studying decided to continue to engage in ctf but already in the organization and preparation of the team for the games.

In 2012, I wrote the first version of FreeHackQuest (the name was coined us me and Alexey Gulyaev) and we did a game at the university.

With the support of Alexei Gulyaev and Vitali Shishkin as well as Konstantin Kryuchkov, Nikita Chizhov and other members of the team, we hung up ads and recruited newcomers.

Next year (2013) the platform was completely rewritten and held by FHQ 2013 again for recruiting, but this time players was not only from our university but also from other cities.

After that we left to hang the platform in the online modes http://fhq.keva.su (the idea was Alexey Gulyaev), which allowed paying attention to keva.

The same platform (with a number of improvements) was used in the conduct of SibirCTF 2014. There were written modules for attack-defense games, but in the latest version were removed due to the complexity of the configuration and the start of the additional daemon.

In 2014 the design was completely changed once again, finalization and so on. The last time was FHQ 2014.

In 2015 I decided to finish and freeze the development as a platform for archive games and to run local small ctfs in the form of jeopady.

At the end of 2016, I began to rewrite the server part on Qt (WebSockets)

In October 2017, FHQ 2017 was played on the split backend / frontend platform. Where the backend worked completely on Qt.

In April 2018: Uploaded backend (fhq-server) to ppa launchpad ubuntu.

Development continues...
